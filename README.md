# Arrays
c++ codes on arrays

This code is to search for a number in an array. It works by first letting the user to enter the number to search for. Then, it goes through the array and compares each element to the targeted/user input value. If the target value is found, the program prints its index and exits. Otherwise, the program prints a message indicating that the number was not found.

this is an example of how to use the program:

Enter number: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Enter the number to search: 4

The number is found at: 3
